# 📝 Simple Flask To-Do App (Dockerized)

This is a small personal project I built to get hands-on experience with Flask and Docker. It’s a minimal To-Do app where you can add and delete tasks, no database, just in-memory list.

The goal was to build something quicklyand containerize it using Docker to practice DevOps fundamentals.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python 3.10
- Flask (lightweight backend)
- HTML (with Jinja2 templating)
- Docker (for containerization)
